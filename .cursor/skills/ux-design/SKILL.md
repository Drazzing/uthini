# UX Design (Laws of UX)

Apply [Laws of UX](https://lawsofux.com/) principles to keep interfaces user-centred, familiar, and low in cognitive load.

## Quick Start

When designing or reviewing UI:

1. **Targets**: Ensure tap/click targets are large enough (Fitts's Law). Nav links and buttons need padding; mobile targets ≥44px.
2. **Choices**: Limit primary options (Hick's Law). 5–7 nav items; chunk long lists.
3. **Familiarity**: Use standard patterns—top nav, hamburger on mobile, clear CTAs (Jakob's Law).
4. **Memory**: Chunk content; avoid more than ~7 items in a single undifferentiated list (Miller's Law).
5. **Aesthetics**: Consistent spacing, hierarchy, and alignment improve perceived usability (Aesthetic-Usability Effect).
6. **Grouping**: Group related elements with proximity; separate sections with clear spacing (Law of Proximity).
7. **Cognitive load**: One primary action per section; clear labels; avoid visual clutter.

## When to Use Each Law

| Situation | Apply |
|-----------|--------|
| Nav, buttons, links | Fitts's Law (target size) |
| Menus, forms, steps | Hick's Law (fewer choices) |
| Layout, patterns | Jakob's Law (familiar) |
| Lists, options | Miller's Law (chunking) |
| Visual polish | Aesthetic-Usability Effect |
| Sections, cards | Law of Proximity |
| Complexity, clarity | Cognitive Load |

## Workflow

1. **Review**: Use [checklist.md](checklist.md) for pre-launch or design review.
2. **Deep reference**: See [laws-reference.md](laws-reference.md) for all 30 laws with definitions and examples.
3. **Fix**: Address violations with concrete changes (e.g. add padding, reduce options, align spacing).
