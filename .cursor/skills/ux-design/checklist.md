# UX Review Checklist

Use before launch or when reviewing a page or flow. Tick items as you verify.

## Layout and Spacing

- [ ] Consistent spacing scale (e.g. 4/8px base) across sections
- [ ] Related elements grouped (Law of Proximity); clear gaps between sections
- [ ] No awkward gaps above headings or between page title and content
- [ ] Alignment consistent (e.g. content max-width, padding)

## Navigation and Targets

- [ ] Nav links and buttons have adequate padding (Fitts's Law); mobile tap targets ≥44px
- [ ] Current/active page indicated in nav
- [ ] Primary nav has 5–7 items (Hick's Law, Miller's Law); secondary links grouped elsewhere
- [ ] Mobile: recognisable menu control (e.g. hamburger) and smooth open/close

## Content and Hierarchy

- [ ] One primary CTA per section; secondary actions visually de-emphasised
- [ ] Clear heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3); no skipped levels
- [ ] Long lists chunked (e.g. feature grid, grouped bullets)
- [ ] Copy is concise; no walls of text without breaks

## Familiarity and Consistency

- [ ] Patterns match user expectations (Jakob's Law): top nav, footer, CTA placement
- [ ] Same components look and behave the same across pages
- [ ] No non-standard patterns without clear affordance

## Accessibility and Performance

- [ ] Focus-visible styles for keyboard users
- [ ] Skip link or equivalent for main content
- [ ] Sufficient colour contrast; not relying on colour alone for meaning
- [ ] Images have appropriate `alt`; form fields have labels

## Forms and Flows

- [ ] Form fields grouped logically (e.g. contact, message)
- [ ] Labels clear; errors specific and near the field
- [ ] Multi-step flows show progress and allow save/return where appropriate
- [ ] Success/error states are clear (Peak-End Rule)
